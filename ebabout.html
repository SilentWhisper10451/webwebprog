            <h2>About the creator of this webpage</h2>
            <p>The creator is a 1st year college student at Christ the King College de Maranding Inc. The creator is a straight B student who loves to do things on his own. 
                 The creator is also an upstart author who goes with the initials "J.M." he somehow ended up on that path due to his hobby of making his own literary works about things he observes daily.
                 Though without first hand experiences on "Love" stuff his works are mostly things about being in a relationship, he quotes that "Being in love is scary but watching people fall and making a work out of it feels great"
                 The creator is an introvert who can ever so casually give you the cold shoulder but he does quietly observe his surroundings for anything that can motivate him to do another piece.
